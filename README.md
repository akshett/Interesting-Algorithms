# Interesting-Algorithms

Describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Gives the worst-case scenario implementation time for the algorithm.
N is the size of the input data set and therefore O(expression), expression decides the proportion of time taken for the algorithm with respect to the size of the input.
Traversing through array is O(N) where N is the size of the array.
Nested loops through an array is O(Nk) where N is the size of the array and k is the number of nests.
